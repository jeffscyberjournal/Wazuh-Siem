## 1. Setup agents and manager for vulnerability scanning

To implement vulnerability scanning with Wazuh, here's a clear breakdown of what needs to be done on both the device running the agent and the Wazuh manager:


### Steps for the Device with the Agent Installed
#### 1. Install and Configure the Wazuh Agent:

   - Ensure the Wazuh agent is installed on the device.

   - Edit the agent's `ossec.conf` file (located at `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` on Linux or in the Wazuh installation folder on Windows).

   - Enable the Syscollector module (xml):

#### 2. To scan all ports

Regarding the <ports all="no">yes</ports> configuration in your ossec.conf file, this will enable the Wazuh agent to scan the ports on your system, but it restricts the scan to "yes" specifically, rather than all ports (all="no"). If your goal is to scan all ports, you should update this line to <ports all="yes">yes</ports>.
As for hotfixes, adding <hotfixes>yes</hotfixes> is recommended if you want the Wazuh agent's Syscollector module to gather information about system hotfixes. Hotfixes provide data about patches applied to your system, which is useful for security and compliance monitoring.



#### 3. Restart the Agent Service:

   - Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the new settings (bash)
 
     systemctl restart wazuh-agent
  

### Steps for the Wazuh Manager

#### 1. Enable Vulnerability Detection Module:

   - On the Wazuh manager, edit the `ossec.conf` file (located at `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`).
   - Find the `<vulnerability-detector>` section and configure it like this (xml):
 
   <img width="214" height="145" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fe94161-f72e-4443-902b-02dcb1217b42" />

 

#### 2. Push Configuration to Agents (Optional for Default Settings):

   - If you'd like all agents to use the same configuration, you can set it in `/var/ossec/etc/shared/default/agent.conf` and restart the manager (bash):
     
     systemctl restart wazuh-manager
     

#### 3. Restart Wazuh Manager:
   - Apply the updated configuration (bash):
     
     systemctl restart wazuh-manager

### Verify and Initiate Scanning

#### 1. Ensure Agent-Manager Connection:

   - On the Wazuh dashboard, confirm that the agent is connected and sending data.
   - Go to **Endpoints** (or **Agents**) and check the status of the installed agent.

#### 2. Check Vulnerability Detection Alerts:
   - From the dashboard, navigate to the **Vulnerability Detection** section.
   - Review alerts for identified vulnerabilities on the agent's device.






## 2. Wazuh’s vulnerability detection module reporting outdated CVEs

Wazuh’s vulnerability detection module reporting outdated CVEs for a newer Ubuntu system that has already patched them. Here's how to address it:

### Why It Happens

	• Wazuh uses NVD (National Vulnerability Database) and vendor feeds to match CVEs against installed packages.
	• Sometimes, version strings or kernel variants (like HWE) don’t align perfectly with CVE metadata.
	• This leads to false positives, especially on rolling or patched systems like Ubuntu 22.04 with HWE kernels.

### How to Reduce or Exclude False Positives

#### 1. Update Vulnerability Feed

Make sure your Wazuh manager is pulling the latest CVE data (bash):

/var/ossec/bin/wazuh-modulesd -f -c /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
Or restart the manager to refresh feeds.

#### 2. Use Package Exclusion
You can exclude specific packages from vulnerability scanning:
	• Create a file: /var/ossec/etc/shared/default/vulnerability-detection/packages-ignore
	• Add entries like:

linux-image-6.8.0-51-generic
linux-generic-hwe-22.04
This tells Wazuh to skip these packages during CVE matching.
#### 3. Suppress Specific CVEs

This feature is in development but not yet fully supported. As of now, you can't mark individual CVEs as false positives directly — but you can:
	• Create a custom rule that sets alert level to 0 for specific CVEs.
	• Example(xml)

<img width="480" height="98" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82a642a3-7d9d-440e-90f3-bd7629201b9e" />


#### 4. Check Package Metadata

Ensure your system reports accurate package versions (bash)

dpkg -l | grep linux
uname -a
If your kernel is newer than the CVE’s affected version, it's likely a false positive.

### Reference Case

A similar issue was reported for CVE-2024-38541 on Ubuntu 22.04 with HWE kernel. The kernel was patched, but Wazuh still flagged it due to version mismatch.







## 3. Common Reasons pfSense Logs Don’t Reach Wazuh Manager

### 1. Remote Logging Misconfiguration
 - Go to Status → System Logs → Settings → Remote Logging Options
 - Enable Remote Logging
 - Set Log Format to BSD
 - Add your Wazuh Manager’s IP and port (usually 514/UDP)
 - Check Everything to forward all logs

### 3. Missing Hostname in Syslog Headers
 - pfSense often omits hostnames in syslog headers, which breaks Wazuh’s pre-decoder
 - Workaround: Use Syslog-ng on pfSense to reformat logs before sending to Wazuh

### 4. Firewall Blocking Port 514
 - On Wazuh Manager, ensure port 514/UDP is open (bash):

sudo ufw allow 514/udp

### 5. No Decoder or Rule Match
 - Wazuh needs the 0455-pfsense_decoders.xml and 0540-pfsense_rules.xml files
 - You can override default rules to log drop events by removing <options>no_log</options>


## 4. Check syslog and Enable syslog collection on wazuh

### Troubleshooting Access to archives.log

#### 1. Check File Existence

Run:
ls -l /var/ossec/logs/archives/
If archives.log isn’t listed, it may not be created yet—especially if **logall** <!-- <logall> --> isn’t enabled or no logs are being archived.

2. Verify Permissions

Try:
 - sudo ls -l /var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.log
If the file exists but you still can’t read it, check ownership:
 - stat /var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.log

You may need to run as root or ensure your user is in the ossec group.

3. Enable Archiving
In /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf, confirm this block exists (xml):
``` <global>
  <logall>yes</logall>
</global> ```

Then restart the manager:
 - sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager

4. Check for Log Rotation
Sometimes archives.log is rotated and renamed. Try:

 - ls /var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.log*
You might find archives.log.1, .gz, or other rotated versions.
